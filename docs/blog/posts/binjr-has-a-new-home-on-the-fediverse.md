# binjr has a new home on the Fediverse!

The social account for _binjr_ on the Fediverse is now hosted on its own dedicated server: https://social.binjr.eu/@binjr

This means we are now completely independent from any third party for this and most importantly that **I am the one** who gets to decide the maximum post length now!! \o/

If you were already following the old `@binjr@fosstodon.org` account, there's nothing for you to do: you should have automatically been added as a follower to the new account, and stopped following the old one.

Shout out to the great folks at https://gotosocial.org/ for making this so easy with their incredibly lightweight Fedi server. Go check it out!
